# IMPORTANT: Before using this file, make sure you have created the corresponding checks
# in Healthchecks.io (or your self-hosted Healthchecks alternative). The UUIDs below are
# generated by Healthchecks.io when you create a check. Without these, the pings will fail.
#
# Each line should contain information for one domain to be monitored in the following format:
#
#   domain s:status_uuid e:[expiry_uuid]
#
# - domain:       The domain name to check (e.g., example.com).
#
# - status_uuid:  The Healthchecks.io (or self-hosted) UUID for the "status" ping. This
#                 endpoint is used for frequent checks (e.g., every 1â€“5 minutes) to verify
#                 if the website is live (HTTP 2xx codes indicate success).
#
# - expiry_uuid:  (Optional) The Healthchecks.io (or self-hosted) UUID for the "expiry" ping.
#                 This endpoint is used to check the domain's registration expiry date via WHOIS.
#                 The expiry check is performed less frequently (once per day) and determines
#                 if the domain has more than 7 days remaining before expiry.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
